#+title: Readme
The first ever README i made in orgmode
* What's this?
Utilising the awesome [[https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook][Jupyter data science image]] to save my soul from the hell that is installing python, jupyter and its dependencies :)

Then using the environment to perform data analysis on a dataset about books (focusing on harry potter as the assignment demanded)
